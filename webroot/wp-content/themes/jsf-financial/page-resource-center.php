                Or a marriage at the breaking point ? <br> In the course of their job, advisers hear all sorts of
                secrets from their clients.</p>

                        lawyer, he'd built up a name for himself in tax and estate planning, but seemed to hit a wall
                        about five years ago. His success was a double-edged sword.
